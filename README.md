## Timeline thoughts

12/16/15 - Decided the best way to gather the information was a script that takes the entire history of any league. This includes teams, owners, scores, margin of victories, schedules, league settings, etc for every year the league has been active. 

12/21/15 - Completed the data parsing, need to figure out how to organize the data so that it can be read for other feature scripts. Thinking to start with .csv files to test, then migrate to SQL when ready.
